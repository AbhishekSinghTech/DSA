# Chapter 01: Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms
Data Structure is a way of collecting and organising data in such a way that we can perform operations on these data in an effective way.
## Why are Data Structures Important?
Efficient Data Management: Store data in an organized manner.
-Improve Performance: Accessing, searching, inserting or deleting elements become faster.
-Reduce Complexity: Code becomes simpler and easier to understand.
-Data Abstraction: Hide the complexity of underlying implementation from users.

## Types of Data Structures
1. Linear Data Structures (One Dimensional)
   - Arrays
   - Linked Lists
2. Non-Linear Data Structures (Multi-Dimensional)
   - Trees
   - Graphs
3. Advanced Data Structures
   - Hash Tables/Hash Maps
   - Stacks
   - Queues
   - Heaps
## What are the Real World Applications of Data Structures?
-Database Management Systems - Data structures are used to store and organize large amounts of data in a structured manner.
-Operating Systems - Data structures are used to manage resources, such as memory allocation and process scheduling. 
-Graphical User Interfaces - Data structures are used to store and display hierarchical data, such as the file system in a computer's file explorer. 
-Computer Networks - Data structures are used to store information about network topology and to implement routing algorithms. 


# Section 02: Arrays in Java
- Array is a linear data structure.It is a container object that holds a fixed number of values of a single type. The length of an array is established when the array is created. After creation, its length is fixed.
